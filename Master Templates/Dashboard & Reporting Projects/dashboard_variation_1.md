**Opener**

You mentioned you’re tired of **manually pulling numbers and worrying if they’re right**.  If you’ve got data scattered across GA4, Search Console and other tools, it’s no wonder.

**Mini proof**

For one agency I consolidated all of their search and call tracking data into one dashboard and their team stopped copying and pasting numbers into spreadsheets.

**Plan**

* Identify the handful of KPIs you actually use to steer your business.
* Wire those sources into Looker Studio and verify the connections so there are no surprises.
* Automate the refresh so that every Monday a link lands in your inbox with the latest figures.

**Result**

You’ll have a consistent, trust‑worthy view of your marketing and search performance without touching a spreadsheet.

**Simple next step**

Share a sample of your current report and note what frustrates you the most – I’ll respond with an outline of how to fix it.

**Closing**

If it looks like a fit, we can move ahead.  Either way you’ll know the options.
