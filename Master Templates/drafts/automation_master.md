**Opener**

You’re doing **[describe repetitive task]** manually several times a week and it’s eating into your day.  Anything you repeat more than three times should probably be scripted.

**Mini proof**

I’ve built small Python and Apps Script solutions that cut manual work by 80 % or more for non‑technical teams.

**Plan**

* Identify the exact steps you repeat and where data comes from and goes to.
* Write a script (Python or Google Apps Script) that performs those steps the same way every time.
* Add simple logging or notifications so you know the job ran and what it did.

**Result**

You’ll free up hours each week and reduce errors because a computer doesn’t get distracted.

**Simple next step**

Describe the process in two or three sentences or send a short loom showing the steps.  That’s enough for me to outline the automation.

**Closing**

If the outline works for you, we can get coding.  If not, you’ll at least know what’s involved.
